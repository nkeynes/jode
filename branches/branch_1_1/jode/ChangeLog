	* jode/expr/Expression.java.in (updateParentTypes): Call setType,
	instead of merging the types.  Other childs want to know about the
	type change as well.
	* jode/decompiler/LocalInfo.java (combineWith): Reorganized a bit,
	but no changes.
	* jode/expr/InvokeOperator.java.in (dumpExpression): Always print
	the ThisOperator if a field is from a parent class of an outer
	class is used.  And always qualify the this operator if not
	innermost.

	* jode/jvm/SyntheticAnalyzer.java.in (checkConstructorAccess):
	Allow the special unifyParam to be the last parameter.

2001-01-30  Jochen Hoenicke  <jochen@gnu.org>

	* jode/decompiler/TabbedPrintWriter.java: Better gnu style handling:
	(openBraceClass) (closeBraceClass)
	(openBraceNoIndent) (closeBraceNoIndent): new functions.
	(closeBraceNoSpace): Removed.
	* jode/decompiler/Options.java (GNU_SPACING): new constant.
	(GNU_STYLE): changed to include GNU_SPACING.
	* jode/decompiler/ClassAnalyzer.java.in (dumpSource): Use
 	open/closeBraceClass.
	* jode/decompiler/MethodAnalyzer.java.in (dumpSource): Use
 	open/closeBraceNoIndent.  Insert a space for GNU_SPACING.
	* jode/decompiler/InvokeOperator.java.in (dumpExpression): Insert
 	a space for GNU_SPACING, use open/closeBraceClass for inner
 	classes.
	* jode/decompiler/UnaryOperator.java (dumpExpression): Insert
 	a space for GNU_SPACING.

	Added pascal style from Rolf Howarth <rolf@squarebox.co.uk>
	* jode/decompiler/Options.java (PASCAL_STYLE): new constant.
	(BRACE_FLUSH_LEFT): dito.
	* jode/decompiler/Decompiler.java (setOption): detect pascal option.
	* jode/decompiler/Main.java (main): dito.
	* jode/decompiler/TabbedPrintWriter.java (openBrace,
 	openBraceContinue, closeBrace, closeBraceNoSpace,
 	closeBraceContinue): handle flush left.

	* jode/type/NullType.java (intersection): Removed, since the
 	version in ReferenceType is more correct.  Before
 	tNull.isOfType(tRange(X,tNull)) returned false, which lead to
 	incorrect behaviour in InvokeOperator.needsCast.
	* jode/decompiler/FieldAnalyzer.java.in (dumpSource): Removed the
 	"= null" hack for final fields; it was not correct, since the
 	field could be initialized in a constructor.
	* jode/decompiler/TabbedPrintWriter.java (BreakPoint.endOp):
	Simplified the code, copy options always from child.
	* jode/jvm/SyntheticAnalyzer.java.in (unifyParam): new field.
	(checkConstructorAccess): Allow the special Parameter, whose
 	purpose is to distinguish the wrapper from the real constructor
 	and give him a "$" in the type signature, to appear at every
 	position.  It doesn't appear at position 1 for inner classes.
	Store the position in unifyParam.
	* jode/expr/InvokeOperator.java (isGetClass): Allow the method to
 	be declared inside an outer class:  We simply check if we can get
	the method analyzer.
	(simplify): handle unifyParam.
	* jode/expr/PopOperator.java (getBreakPenalty): return penalty of
 	inner expression. (dumpExpression): Call dumpExpression of
 	subexpression immediately without priority.
